## 🚗 Path Planning Overview

This ROS 2 node implements **path planning** for an autonomous pupil transport vehicle navigating a simplified city represented as a graph. It uses the A* algorithm to generate an optimal route through key mission points, while also handling emergency rerouting logic.

### 📌 Features

- Subscribes to:
  - `/odom` – Receives vehicle's current position
  - `/emergency_state` – Monitors emergency conditions
- Publishes:
  - `/path_stage` – Custom `PathStage` message with planned trajectory and stage status
- Mission flow:
  1. Waits for `emergency_state = False` to begin the mission.
  2. Follows this goal sequence:
     - Pickup 1
     - Pickup 2
     - School
  3. If `emergency_state = True` at any time, reroutes immediately to the **hospital**.
  4. If the emergency clears, resumes the mission from the current location and next unfinished goal.
- Detects nearest node from vehicle's current location to plan realistic routes.
- Indicates if a goal is the **final stage** (school or hospital) via the `is_final_stage` flag.

### 🧠 Algorithm

Uses the **A\*** search algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes based on a predefined city graph with nodes and directed edges.

## 🔓 **User Story 1**

> **As a Path Planning component, I want to generate routes based on the vehicle’s state—normal or emergency—so the ego-vehicle can follow a smooth path or safely reroute to the hospital when needed.**


### Acceptance Criteria
- **1.1**-The Path Planning component shall define a directed graph with (x, y) nodes and weighted edges, covering all driving scenarios in the model city.

- **1.2**-The Path Planning component shall subscribe to the /odom topic to receive the vehicle’s position and orientation.
  
- **1.3**-The Path Planning component shall subscribe to the /emergency_state topic to determine whether the vehicle is in normal or emergency mode.

- **1.4** -If /emergency_state is true, the component shall immediately plan a path from the current location to the hospital.

- **1.5**-If /emergency_state is false, the Path Planning component shall plan to the next goal at each step — first pickup, then second pickup, then school — advancing on each false condition.
  
- **1.6**-The Path Planning component shall use the A* algorithm to compute the optimal path between nodes.

- **1.7**-The component shall publish the planned path as a list of PathStage messages to the /path_stage topic, Each PathStage shall include:
Position (x, y) ,
is_final_stage (if True : final , false>waiting)
